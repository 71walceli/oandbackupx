oandbackup
=======
a backup program for android. requires root and allows you to backup individual apps and their data.

a working busybox and rsync installation is required at the moment. 
instructions for optaining an rsync binary can be found here: http://linux.wxs.ro/2011/08/05/rsync-your-android/  
a busybox executable can be obtained from various sources. here a instructions for building it from source: http://mobisocial.stanford.edu/news/2011/02/compile-busybox-on-android-os/   
unfortunately i cannot vouch for the quality of either.

an apk build of oandbackup is available on f-droid's servers: https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=dk.jens.backup
