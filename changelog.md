changelog
=========

0.2.3 (development)
------------------
 * added portuguese translation. thanks to SÃ©rgio Marques (smarquespt).

0.2.2 (2013-09-10)
-------------------
 * compression has changed from gzip to zip (please redo your backups - any apps no longer installed having backups in tar format should manually be recompressed to zip format. support for uncompressing tar will be deprecated in the near future.) 
    * if the data folder of the app doesn't contain any files (or only empty directories and the lib/ folder) no zip will be created since java.util.zip can't handle empty zip files
 * option for rsync output disabled due to deadlocking on apps with a high number of files
 * batch operations now has sorting and filtering too
 
0.2.1 (2013-09-03)
------------------
 * fixing bug where busybox tar is not compiled with support for gzip

0.2.0 (2013-08-30)
--------------------
 * compression of app data backup (tar + gzip)
 * new logfile format. as the old logs are converted on the first run after updating to this version, please notice that it will take a little longer to start up (on one of my devices each log is written in approximately half a second). all timestamps for last backup will be reset in the app interface due to changes to a more flexible reading method but the original values will remain as strings in the logs (look for "lastBackup") until they are overwritten by a new backup, so if the date displayed in the app is important you can change to value of "lastBackupMillis" (milliseconds since unix epoch for desired date). this is unfortunately not possible to do automatically due to the unpredictability of various date formats.
 * bug fixes:
    * refresh while searching
    * sorting 
    * searching after restoring with apk or uninstalling
    * chown bug if uid less than five characters
    * chown and chmod bug where certain packages were not recognised by the system after restore due to the lib folder  

0.1.14 (2013-08-04)
