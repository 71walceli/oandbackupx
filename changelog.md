changelog
=========

0.1.1 (2020-03-25)
-------------------
 * initial X release
 * restructured and cleaned the app: adding Bottombar-based navigation and Sort and Filter FAB(for now: only the basic filters)
 * rewritten Batch-(Activity, Adapter and Sorter) and most the layouts
 * partially rewritten Main-(Activity and Sorter)
 * completed the German translation
 * had to shut the preferences out for now: to solve the compatibility issues, I have to fully restructure and rewrite the preferences and that'll be one of the next steps(fix priority high).
 * other drawback: setting a toolbar on some activities(scheduler, help and tools) is causing a crash, so they have to do with no toolbar for now(fix priority minimal).
