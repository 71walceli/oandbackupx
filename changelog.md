 * rewritten Batch-(Activity, Adapter and Sorter) and most the layouts
 * partially rewritten Main-(Activity and Sorter)

 * had to shut the preferences out for now: to solve the compatibility issues, I have to fully restructure and rewrite the preferences and that'll be one of the next steps(fix priority high).
